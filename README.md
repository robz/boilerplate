# boilerplate
In which I finally start writing javascript in the "modern" way, by using a static type checker, testing framework, an automated transform, CommonJS bundling, and minification pipeline, and all those shiny new ES6 features.

* static type checker: [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)
* testing framework: [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
* ES6, JSX, type transform: [6to5](https://github.com/6to5/6to5)
* minification: [uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)
* bundling: [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
* build automation: [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify)
